### Applying Genetic Algorithm for Credit Risk Modeling
# This project demonstrates the application of a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to optimize a logistic regression model for credit risk prediction. The goal is to find the best hyperparameters for the logistic regression model to improve its accuracy in predicting whether a customer will default on a loan.
